# BunkerCoin

A low-bandwidth, short-wave-radio-compatible blockchain protocol.

This repository is *work-in-progress*.

We're using Alpenglow for consensus with an adapted networking layer (to be developed) - status can be seen [here](https://github.com/TheBunkerCoin/alpenglow).

## Building

Ensure you have a recent stable Rust toolchain installed.

```bash
rustup update stable
cargo check
```

Nothing is stabilised yet, expect rapid iteration.
